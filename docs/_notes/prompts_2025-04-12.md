I'm in the process of modernizing an old browser-based app. In the latest step I reordered the dir structure and did a bit of renaming, no significant code changes. I have moved from using vite to using webpack. I've messed up, broken it. You will find the previous working source in project knowledge under `trestle-previous`, the current is in the root dir. I know there are issues with `webpack.config.js` but there may be other things. Can you please analyse the previous code and compare it to the latest thinking deeply. Check for likely errors, and also make me a new `webpack.config.js`. ES modules are used through. Please give me any code as individual, complete source files, clearly labeled as to their location.
