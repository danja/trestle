# Toolbar Requirements

This document outlines the elements and their positioning within the application's top toolbar, based on the provided screenshot.

## Left Side of the Toolbar

* **Hamburger Menu Icon (‚ò∞):** Located at the far left. This icon should trigger the display of a primary navigation menu (e.g., a sidebar or drawer).
* **Back Arrow Icon (<):** Positioned immediately to the right of the hamburger menu. This should navigate the user to the previous screen or page in the application's history.
* **Forward Arrow Icon (>):** Located to the right of the back arrow. This should navigate the user forward in the application's history (if available).
* **Home Icon (üè†):** Situated to the right of the forward arrow. Clicking this icon should navigate the user to the application's main homepage or dashboard.
* **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Located to the right of the home icon. This element visually represents the user's current location within the application's structure. It consists of a series of clickable text labels separated by right-pointing chevrons (">"). In the example, it shows: `Musa > tests > add banner`. Each segment ("Musa", "tests") should likely be clickable to navigate to that parent level. The final segment ("add banner") represents the current page.

## Right Side of the Toolbar

* **Search Bar:** Located on the far right of the toolbar.
    * It is a rectangular input field where users can type search queries.
    * A magnifying glass icon (üîç) is present inside the left side of the input field, visually indicating its function.
    * The placeholder text "Search" is visible within the empty input field, providing a hint to the user.
* **Favorites Icon (‚òÜ):** Positioned to the left of the options/menu icon. This icon should allow users to mark or access their favorite or saved items within the application.
* **Options/Menu Icon (‚ò∞ with a vertical line on the left):** Located to the right of the favorites icon. This icon should provide access to additional options, settings, or a context-specific menu related to the current view or the application in general.

## Visual Style

The toolbar appears to have a clean, predominantly white background, allowing the icons and text to be clearly visible. The icons are simple and modern in style.

This document should provide a clear understanding of the toolbar's structure and elements for the development team.
