# Refactoring TrestleView into Modular Components

## Overview

The TrestleView component has been refactored into smaller, more focused modules to improve maintainability, reusability, and separation of concerns. This document outlines the changes made and the new component structure.

## Changes Made

1. Created a component directory structure at `src/js/view/components/`
2. Extracted the following components:
   - `TreeNode`: Handles individual node rendering and functionality
   - `DragDropHandler`: Manages drag and drop operations
   - `CardDetail`: Handles card detail functionality
   - `ContextMenu`: Handles the context menu operations
   - `ExpanderButton`: Manages node expansion/collapse
   - `InlineEditor`: Manages inline editing of node titles
   - `NodeSelector`: Handles node selection and navigation
3. Updated TrestleView to use these new components
4. Created component tests to verify functionality

## Benefits

- **Improved Maintainability**: Each component now has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and modify.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different parts of the application.
- **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation.
- **Scalability**: New features can be added by creating new components or extending existing ones.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles a specific aspect of the UI.

## Component Descriptions

### TreeNode

Responsible for rendering individual nodes in the tree and managing their children. Handles the DOM structure of a node.

### DragDropHandler

Manages the drag and drop functionality for moving nodes in the tree. Handles all drag events and updates the DOM and model accordingly.

### CardDetail

Handles the node detail view that appears when a node's detail button is clicked. Manages the card's visibility, content, and events.

### ContextMenu

Handles the context menu operations, including the shortcuts panel and mobile menu. Also adds contextual buttons for adding new nodes.

### ExpanderButton

Manages the expand/collapse functionality for nodes. Handles the toggle button events and updates the node's state.

### InlineEditor

Handles inline editing of node titles. Manages the contentEditable state, keyboard events during editing, and updates the model when editing is complete.

### NodeSelector

Manages node selection and keyboard navigation. Handles the selected state of nodes and provides navigation methods.

## Future Improvements

- Further refine component API for better reusability
- Add more comprehensive tests for each component
- Consider implementing a component state management system
- Review event handling for optimization opportunities
