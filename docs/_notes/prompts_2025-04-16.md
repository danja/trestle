We need to refactor Trestle (source is in project knowledge) to be backed by an RDF model using RDF-Ext (docs in project knowledge) wrapped in `src/domain/rdf/RDFModel.js` rather than the plain object-based `src/js/model/TrestleModel.js`. Having `TrestleModel` act as a proxy to `RDFModel` is the obvious first step. But before that we need to create some Jasmine tests (with chai) under `/test/` to ensure we don't break anything in the process. Please analyse the codebase and think deeply about the role of `TrestleModel` and what might break if it's changed, and create unit tests accordingly. Only use the packages already in `package.json` using ES module style. If mock web pages are needed use jsdom. Render all code as individual, complete artifacts, clearly labeled with their location.

Please add another menu item 'Debug'. On clicking this, a text area will appear below the main view with a serialization of the current rdf model, in turtle syntax.
