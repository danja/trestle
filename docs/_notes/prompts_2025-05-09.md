1. Delete Button and Delete Functionality
Problem
The delete button (.ts-delete) is present in the template, but nowhere in the code is it wired up to actually trigger a delete action.
There is no event listener on the delete button to emit a view:deleteNode event with the correct node ID.
Consequence
Clicking the delete button does nothing.
Keyboard shortcuts for delete (e.g., Ctrl+X) are also not handled anywhere in the view or editor logic.
Fix
In the TreeNode component, after rendering, add an event listener to the .ts-delete button to emit the correct event.
Add a global keyboard handler (in InlineEditor or main view) for Ctrl+X to trigger delete for the selected node.
2. Drag to Indent/Outdent
Problem
The drag-and-drop logic is implemented in DragDropHandler, but it is only initialized if you call setupDragListeners().
In the TrestleView, after rendering, the drag-and-drop handler is created and initialize() is called, but the initialize() method in DragDropHandler does not actually call setupDragListeners().
As a result, drag-and-drop event listeners are not attached, so drag-to-indent/outdent does not work.
Fix
In DragDropHandler, ensure that initialize() calls setupDragListeners() so that drag-and-drop works after every render.
3. Other List Management Shortcuts
Problem
Many keyboard shortcuts (duplicate, move, indent, outdent, etc.) are only handled when editing a node (i.e., when the title is contenteditable and focused).
There is no global keyboard handler for these actions when a node is selected but not being edited.
Fix
Add a global keyboard event handler (in TrestleView or InlineEditor) that listens for relevant shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+D for duplicate, Tab/Shift+Tab for indent/outdent, etc.) and emits the appropriate events for the currently selected node.
4. Summary of Required Edits
TreeNode.js: Wire up the delete button to emit a delete event.
DragDropHandler.js: Ensure initialize() calls setupDragListeners().
TrestleView.js or InlineEditor.js: Add a global keyboard handler for delete, duplicate, indent, outdent, etc., for the selected node (not just when editing).
