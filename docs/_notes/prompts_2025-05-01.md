Trestle, source in project knowledge needs work on the UI. Things like the '+' button seem unnecessary. Can you think deeply on how to streamline it and improve the user experience. There are better outliners from emacs mode, Dave Winer systems, especially Workflowy, with ideas to draw from. Ensure you use modern vanilla es modular js and don't break anything. Other than that, please think deeply and reimagine how it can be made really good. Render all code as complete, individual artifacts, clearly labeled with their location.
